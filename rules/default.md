# Default Subtitle Translation Rules

## General Principles

- Translate naturally and idiomatically for the target language
- Maintain the tone and style of the original dialogue
- Keep translations concise - subtitles must be readable within the time limit

## Character Limits

- Keep each subtitle line readable within its duration
- Typically 40-45 characters per line maximum
- Split long sentences naturally at phrase boundaries

## Numbers

- Use numerals for large numbers (100+)
- Spell out small numbers when it sounds more natural
- Keep consistency within the same scene

## Units

- Convert to units familiar to your target audience when helpful
- Keep original units if commonly understood internationally

## Currency

- Keep original currency values
- Do not convert exchange rates

## Names

- Keep original names unless there's a well-established localized version
- For historical figures or celebrities, use the commonly known name in target language

## Filler Words

- Omit meaningless fillers (um, uh, like) when they don't add character
- Keep them if they convey hesitation or character personality

## Punctuation

- Follow standard punctuation rules for the target language
- Avoid ending sentences with periods in subtitles (except for emphasis)
- Use question marks and exclamation points appropriately

## Dialogue Format

When multiple speakers appear in one subtitle:
- Prefix each speaker's line with a dash -
- Separate speakers clearly

## Style

- Match the register of the original (formal/informal)
- Preserve humor, wordplay, and cultural references when possible
- Adapt idioms to equivalent expressions in target language
